Solar storms or celestial weather phenomena such as solar flares and coronal meteors (CME) can have many effects on the solar system. including the world How do they affect the location: 


 1. Solar system (general) . - 

Cosmic rays:  Solar storms release large amounts of energy. This could affect space missions, astronauts, and satellites throughout the solar system. Spacecraft can be damaged by this radiation if they are not properly shielded. 

Space exploration: Spacecraft exploring other planets may malfunction or lose communications due to radiation. 

Planetary Winds: Solar storms can destroy a planet's atmosphere. Especially those that don't have a strong magnetic field, like Mars.
 

 2. World - 

Earth's magnetic field: The Sun's magnetic field interacts with the Earth's magnetic field. causing magnetic waves The most noticeable effect is 

Aurora (Northern and Southern Lights) near the polar regions. - 

Satellite Damage: High energy solar storms can damage satellites. Accuracy of GPS and communication systems -

 Electrical System: Solar storms can release electricity into Earth's power grids. Cause power outages or damage infrastructure. - 

Emissions: Airplanes flying at high altitudes or near greenhouses may have increased greenhouse gas emissions. This affects flight attendants and passengers. - 

Communication system: Radio communication Especially long-range HF (high frequency) radios can be disrupted. Affects military and aviation operations. The severity of these effects depends on the intensity of the solar waves. Normally, the Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from danger. But in very severe cases

Coronal Mass Ejections



Then, there are coronal mass ejections, which rip millions or billions of tons of plasma from the Sun's atmosphere, catapulting it through the solar system at speeds of up to 9 million km/h.
When these monsters hit us, nothing happens on Earth. While even smaller storms can damage satellites, affect radio communication, or be dangerous to astronauts, for people on the surface, space weather is harmless. Earth's atmosphere protects us from the worst effects of a solar flare by absorbing the blast of X-rays high up in the atmosphere, well before it reaches the surface. The electrified plasma from a CME is deflected by the Earth's magnetic field, diverting the energy storm to the North and South Poles,

Where energetic particles fall into the atmosphere, causing the atmosphere to glow and creating beautiful auroras. As with any sort of weather— most of the time, things are fine. Sometimes, there are hurricanes, though. Or in the case of the Sun, solar superstorms. And we know that they happen once or twice every century. If one were to happen today, we would first detect strong solar flares, a sort of flash before the much more dangerous thunder.

The thunder is a CME, consisting of billions of tons of hot magnetic plasma that crosses the 150 million kilometers between the Sun and Earth in less than a day. When it arrives, it causes a shockwave that violently compresses the Earth's magnetic field and transfers energy into the magnetosphere. But it can get worse. If the magnetic field of the CME is aligned to Earth's in just the right way, the two magnetic fields merge. As the magnetic cloud passes over Earth, it stretches the Earth's field into a long tail. Eventually, the energy stored in the tail becomes too much to contain. It snaps and explosively releases its energy towards Earth. A geomagnetic storm has begun. A few hundred years ago, nobody would have cared. This storm gushing over the Earth is not relevant for machines made out of meat and bones. But it's very relevant for machines made out of metal and wire. Remember the dynamo? Magnetism creates electric currents. Earth in the 21st century is covered in millions of kilometers of wires, transporting electricity, and a complex grid of machines, like transformers, that make this transfer possible. A CME's energy can induce currents in our power grid that can either completely shut it down, or worse, destroy the transformer stations that keep our grid running. This has happened already, like when the Quebec power grid failed after a strong solar storm in 1989. But in general, our engineers know how to deal with these storms, and so we usually don't even notice. The last time a solar hurricane washed over Earth was in 1859: The Carrington Event, the largest geomagnetic storms ever observed on Earth.

Studies projected that it would've inflicted serious damage to electronic systems globally, costing up to $2.6 trillion to the US alone. The time to replace all the damaged systems was estimated at between 4 and 10 years. It's hard to say how bad it could have been. Experts disagreed. Some assumed there would just be temporary blackouts, but others worried it could be much worse. We won't know for sure until a big solar hurricane hits us. The probability of such an event is estimated to be 12% per decade.
A 2019 paper found that even calm stars, like our Sun, can create superflares every few thousand years. Eruptions orders of magnitude stronger than the strongest storms we have observed in the Solar System. If such a storm hits us unprepared, the consequences could be catastrophic. It's hard to overstate how much we depend on electricity. It's not just the lights at home. It means no computers, no communication, no navigation. A sustained power outage might lead to a breakdown of the supply chain, water supply systems failing and hospital generators running dry, supermarkets not being refilled while food rots in the fields. The lack of power might make it extremely hard to reboot our broken power grid, taking years or decades to restart our starving civilization.
Solutions
Fortunately, even though solar storms aren't preventable, virtually all of their nasty side effects are. Scientists observing the Sun have a few hours up to a few days to see a CME coming. And the engineers working the systems that keep the world running are well aware of the risks posed by solar storms. Transformers and substations can be taken offline— short preventative blackouts— or in other words, by unplugging stuff. Engineers can open up extra lines to dissipate the extra power. And with investment and upgrades cheap compared to those other natural disasters require, we could protect the world's electric grid against even the nastiest of storms. But we do need to prepare. While the risk is manageable, it is real. For while our Sun bathes us in warm and pleasant light, one day, it might send a monster our way that we better be ready for.
