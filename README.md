# Solar Storms
Solar storms or celestial weather phenomena such as solar flares and coronal meteors (CME) can have many effects on the solar system. including the world How do they affect the location: 


 ## 1. Solar system (general) . - 

  -> Cosmic rays:  Solar storms release large amounts of energy. This could affect space missions, astronauts, and satellites throughout the solar system. Spacecraft can be damaged by this radiation if they are not properly shielded. 
  -> Space exploration: Spacecraft exploring other planets may malfunction or lose communications due to radiation. 
  -> Planetary Winds: Solar storms can destroy a planet's atmosphere. Especially those that don't have a strong magnetic field, like Mars.
 

 ## 2. World - 

  -> Earth's magnetic field: The Sun's magnetic field interacts with the Earth's magnetic field. causing magnetic waves The most noticeable effect is 
    - Aurora (Northern and Southern Lights) near the polar regions. 
    - Satellite Damage: High energy solar storms can damage satellites. Accuracy of GPS and communication systems
    - Electrical System: Solar storms can release electricity into Earth's power grids. Cause power outages or damage infrastructure. 
    - Emissions: Airplanes flying at high altitudes or near greenhouses may have increased greenhouse gas emissions. This affects flight attendants and passengers.
    - Communication system: Radio communication Especially long-range HF (high frequency) radios can be disrupted. Affects military and aviation operations. The severity of these effects depends on the intensity of the solar waves. Normally, the Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from danger. But in very severe cases
